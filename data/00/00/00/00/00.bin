  |                                                                         |
  |   Deemo is a mysterious being who lives alone in a castle, playing      |
  |   the piano to itself.                                                  |
  |                                                                         |
  |   One day, a little girl with no memory falls from the sky, breaking    |
  |   his solitude.                                                         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Deemo feels compelled to help her get home to her world.              |
  |                                                                         |
  |   While looking for a way to return her to the sky, Deemo notices a     |
  |   small sapling which grows the more music is played.                   |
  |                                                                         |
  |   If Deemo is able to make it grow into a tree, tall enough so it       |
  |   would reach the window in the ceiling, she may just be able to get    |
  |   home.                                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   As the two interact, Deemo learns what it means to have a friend.     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   What awaits the two when the little girl regains her memory?          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This is a slightly strange, touching tale --                          |
  |                                                                         |
